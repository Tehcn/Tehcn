# Hello, GitHub!

My name is Noah Perry and I am a 16 year old frontend web developer! (I only do fullstack development on my personal projects as of now)

## About Me

I live in the midwestern United States, specifically, Wisconsin.

Originally, when I first started to learn to code, my end goal was making a mod for Minecraft, and while I've already achieved this goal, the process was one, and still is, one of the most eye opening experiences of my life. I discovered a whole new world of developing website, apps, and games.

Ever since, I've been programming nearly every day, improving my coding, and learning new ways to solve problems.
